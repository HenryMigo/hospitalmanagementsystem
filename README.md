# hospitalmanagementsystem
Group Project from University

This is a hospital management system that was made by a group of us during University for the Software Engineering module.
It is made in .NET and C#, you have a ward consisting of around 6-8 beds, once a patient has been set up then using the 
.csv file it shall simulate a bedside monitor, if the numbers go outside the set upper and lower limit an alarm will tigger.
An email is then sent to the email address that has been set telling the person an alarm has been tiggered and what triggered
it. Consaltants can also register and deregister when they are on shift.
